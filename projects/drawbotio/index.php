						Homemade stepper driver from discrete transistors
					</div>
          This is a wireless drawing robot I built with a friend for the 2014 Boilermake hackathon.  We didn't have a stepper driver at the time, so we built one with some discrete power transistors and a shift register.  Boilermake provided some hackable badges with ATMegas and wireless modules which we repurposed with one badge controlling the robot and another badge acting as a wireless remote.
